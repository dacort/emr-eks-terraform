# EMR on EKS with Terraform

There's currently a [pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/20003) open for EMR on EKS support in Terraform.

Until that gets merged, you can build your own version of the AWS Provider to test out the new code.

üíÅ _Please note that this code is a proof-of-concept and not intended for production use_

## Building the provider

### Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.26+ (to deploy your cluster)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16 (to build the provider plugin)
    - Do **NOT** use Go 1.17 as it will error on [`gofmt`](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17#gofmt)
    - Also if you can not use the offical Go module proxy, the project will not build due to [this issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29442)

Here's the [full documentation on building the AWS provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md), but in short here's what you need to do.

Clone the repository and change into the directory

```shell
git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws
cd terraform-provider-aws
```

Checkout the pull request.

```shell
git fetch origin pull/20003/head:emr-eks-terraform
git checkout emr-eks-terraform
```

Run `make tools`. This will install the needed tools for the provider.

```shell
make tools
```

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` (default: `$HOME/go`) directory.

```shell
make build
```

You should now have a `terraform-provider-aws` binary in your `$GOPATH`

```shell
which terraform-provider-aws
```

You'll need this path for the next step.

## Override your AWS provider

In order to make use of the change, you need to populate your Terraform CLI configuration file (`~/.terraformrc`) with the directory your new binary is in.

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "hashicorp/aws" = "/Users/username/go/bin"
  }
  direct {}
}
```

## Deploy your EMR on EKS virtual cluster!

One note before getting started. The version of the EMR on EKS module needs to be pinned to `17.9.0` due to a [breaking change](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/issues/1570) and the fact this PR is based off a specific version of the AWS provider.

The Terraform example provisions everything you need:
- A new VPC (with the [AWS VPC module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest))
- An EKS cluster with a managed node group (with the [AWS EKS module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/latest))
- All the necessary IAM and Kubernetes roles as mentioned in the [EMR on EKS Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/setting-up.html) documenation

*Please note that I've only run this end-to-end a couple times, so there may be some dependencies that require you to run `terraform apply` again.*

By default, Terraform will use your default AWS profile and region. 

```shell
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The EKS cluster can take about 10-15 minutes to provision.

## Running a job

Now that your cluster is up, you should be able to run a job. Because the [EKS cluster autoscaler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-autoscaler.html) is not installed by default, if you want to anything more complicated than the example below, you'll need to scale the cluster up manually.

The below example just runs a sample calculation of Pi and enables CloudWatch logging.

The EMR on EKS virtual cluster ID is provided in a `emr-virtual-cluster-id` output and the role to run the job is in the `emr-eks-job-role` output.

```shell
export EMR_EKS_CLUSTER_ID=<CLUSTER_ID>
export EMR_EKS_EXECUTION_ARN=arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/tf_emr_eks_job_role

aws emr-containers start-job-run \
    --virtual-cluster-id ${EMR_EKS_CLUSTER_ID} \
    --name sample-pi \
    --execution-role-arn ${EMR_EKS_EXECUTION_ARN} \
    --release-label emr-6.3.0-latest \
    --job-driver '{
        "sparkSubmitJobDriver": {
            "entryPoint": "local:///usr/lib/spark/examples/src/main/python/pi.py"
        }
    }' \
    --configuration-overrides '{
        "monitoringConfiguration": {
            "cloudWatchMonitoringConfiguration": {
                "logGroupName": "/aws/eks/emr-spark",
                "logStreamNamePrefix": "pi"
            }
        }
    }'
```
